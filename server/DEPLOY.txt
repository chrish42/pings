Deployment
==========

Deployment of the Pings server is automated using Fabric. All deployment
tasks are defined in the fabfile.py file. You can then run a particular
task on multiple computers through the ``fab`` command. You can also get a
list of the available tasks by running ``fab --list``.

Here are the relevant, top-level Fabric tasks for deployment to production:

launch_prod_instances
  Launches a new set of AWS EC2 instances for the production setup.

prepare_prod_hosts
  Prepares production hosts: install required .deb packages, creates
  "pings" user, etc.

deploy_prod
  Deploys the current Pings server source to all production hosts.
