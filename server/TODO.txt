Important
=========

* Refine the code that returns a list of addresses to be pinged. We may
  want to do something smarted than simply pinging completely random
  addresses.

* Configure front-end proxy to guard against very long POST request from
  clients (via max request length).

* Add some tests to check that we don't break any of the parts when making
  changes.
