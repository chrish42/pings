Essential
========

* Fix leaderboard zeromq retrieval code! The SUB socket does not have the
  exact semantic that we want (retrieve the latest result always, ignore
  past ones). Possible fix: spawn thread that reads the SUB socket and
  makes the latest result available via inproc zeromq socket. Also,
  actually display leaderboards results in Jinja2 template!

Important
=========

* Refine the code that returns a list of addresses to be pinged. We may
  want to do something smarted than simply pinging completely random
  addresses.

* Configure front-end proxy to guard against very long POST request from
  clients (via max request length).

* Add some tests to check that we don't break any of the parts when making
  changes.
