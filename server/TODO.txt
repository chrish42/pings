Essential
=========

* Guard against very long replies from clients. (In practice: max
  reply length.)


Important
=========

* Refine the code that returns a list of addresses to be pinged. We may
  want to do something smarted than simply pinging completely random
  addresses.

* Add some tests to check that we don't break any of the parts when making
  changes.
