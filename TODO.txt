* Replace the test code that returns a list of addresses to be pinged by
  code that does real work instead of returning a couple addresses in

* Consider whether we should be creating a new file more often than every
  hour for the storage_server. Maybe every 10 or 5 minutes would be better?

* Add some tests to check that we don't break any of the parts when making
  changes.
